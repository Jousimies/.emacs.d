Toggle fontification of Dash special variables.

Dash-Fontify mode is a buffer-local minor mode intended for Emacs
Lisp buffers.  Enabling it causes the special variables bound in
anaphoric Dash macros to be fontified.  These anaphoras include
`it', `it-index', `acc', and `other'.  In older Emacs versions
which do not dynamically detect macros, Dash-Fontify mode
additionally fontifies Dash macro calls.

See also `dash-fontify-mode-lighter' and
`global-dash-fontify-mode'.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the `Dash-Fontify
mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable the mode, and if
it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable the
mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable the mode
if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate the variable `dash-fontify-mode'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it is
disabled.

At first glance, this method may seem convenient, but in reality, it was created solely for testing purposes during development. Its role is to verify that all transformation patterns are properly traversed, and it was never intended for regular use. In fact, the developers themselves do not use it at all and strongly discourage its use.

Using this method in practice leads to unnecessary stress, as it forces traversal through every possible transformation pattern, making the conversion process excessively long. Moreover, under the current default settings, the method may not even complete a full cycle depending on the mode in use.

For example, in modes where hyphens are not considered part of variable names, a string like `foo-bar' will be split into `foo' and `bar', and the transformation will only proceed on `bar'. This means the intended conversion process can be interrupted midway depending on the context.

For these reasons, this method should not be used as part of your regular workflow. It is strictly meant for internal verification during development, and we advise against using it in day-to-day usage." t)

(autoload 'posframe-show "posframe" "\
Pop up a posframe to show STRING at POSITION.

 (1) POSITION

POSITION can be:
1. An integer, meaning point position.
2. A cons of two integers, meaning absolute X and Y coordinates.
3. Other type, in which case the corresponding POSHANDLER should be
   provided.

 (2) POSHANDLER

POSHANDLER is a function of one argument returning an actual
position.  Its argument is a plist of the following form:

  (:position xxx
   :poshandler xxx
   :font-height xxx
   :font-width xxx
   :posframe xxx
   :posframe-width xxx
   :posframe-height xxx
   :posframe-buffer xxx
   :parent-frame xxx
   :parent-window-start xxx
   :parent-window-end xxx
   :parent-window-left xxx
   :parent-window-top xxx
   :parent-frame-width xxx
   :parent-frame-height xxx
   :parent-window xxx
   :parent-window-width  xxx
   :parent-window-height xxx
   :mouse-x xxx
   ;mouse-y xxx
   :minibuffer-height xxx
   :mode-line-height  xxx
   :header-line-height xxx
   :tab-line-height xxx
   :x-pixel-offset xxx
   :y-pixel-offset xxx
   :parent-text-scale-mode-amount xxx)

By default, poshandler is auto-selected based on the type of POSITION,
but the selection can be overridden using the POSHANDLER argument.

The builtin poshandler functions are listed below:

1.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-center'
2.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-center'
3.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-left-corner'
4.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-right-corner'
5.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-left-or-right-other-corner'
6.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-center'
7.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-left-corner'
8.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-right-corner'
9.  `posframe-poshandler-window-center'
10.  `posframe-poshandler-window-top-center'
11. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-left-corner'
12. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-right-corner'
13. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-center'
14. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-left-corner'
15. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-right-corner'
16. `posframe-poshandler-point-top-left-corner'
17. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner'
18. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner-upward'
19. `posframe-poshandler-point-window-center'
20. `posframe-poshandler-point-frame-center'

 (3) POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO

POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO is a plist, which will prepend to the
argument of poshandler function: `info', it will *OVERRIDE* the
exist key in `info'.

 (4) BUFFER-OR-NAME

This posframe's buffer is BUFFER-OR-NAME, which can be a buffer
or a name of a (possibly nonexistent) buffer.

buffer name can prefix with space, for example \" *mybuffer*\", so
the buffer name will hide for ibuffer and `list-buffers'.

 (5) NO-PROPERTIES

If NO-PROPERTIES is non-nil, The STRING's properties will
be removed before being shown in posframe.

 (6) HEIGHT, MAX-HEIGHT, MIN-HEIGHT, WIDTH, MAX-WIDTH and MIN-WIDTH

These arguments are specified in the canonical character width
and height of posframe, more details can be found in docstring of
function `fit-frame-to-buffer',

 (7) LEFT-FRINGE and RIGHT-FRINGE

If LEFT-FRINGE or RIGHT-FRINGE is a number, left fringe or
right fringe with be shown with the specified width.

 (8) BORDER-WIDTH, BORDER-COLOR, INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR

By default, posframe shows no borders, but users can specify
borders by setting BORDER-WIDTH to a positive number.  Border
color can be specified by BORDER-COLOR.

INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR are same as
BORDER-WIDTH and BORDER-COLOR, but do not suggest to use for the
reason:

   Add distinct controls for child frames' borders (Bug#45620)
   http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=ff7b1a133bfa7f2614650f8551824ffaef13fadc

 (9) FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR

Posframe's font as well as foreground and background colors are
derived from the current frame by default, but can be overridden
using the FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR arguments,
respectively.

 (10) CURSOR, TTY-NON-SELECTED-CURSOR and WINDOW-POINT

By default, cursor is not showed in posframe, user can let cursor
showed with this argument help by set its value to a `cursor-type'.

TTY-NON-SELECTED-CURSOR will let redisplay put the terminal
cursor in a non-selected frame, which is useful when use
vertico-posframe like package in tty.

When cursor need to be showed in posframe, user may need to set
WINDOW-POINT to the point of BUFFER, which can let cursor showed
at this point.

 (11) RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE

By default, posframe will display no header-line, mode-line and
tab-line.  In case a header-line, mode-line or tab-line is
desired, users can set RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE
to t.

 (12) INITIALIZE

INITIALIZE is a function with no argument.  It will run when
posframe buffer is first selected with `with-current-buffer'
in `posframe-show', and only run once (for performance reasons).

 (13) LINES-TRUNCATE

If LINES-TRUNCATE is non-nil, then lines will truncate in the
posframe instead of wrap.

 (14) OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS

OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS is very powful, *all* the valid frame parameters
used by posframe's frame can be overridden by it.

NOTE: some `posframe-show' arguments are not frame parameters, so they
can not be overrided by this argument.

 (15) TIMEOUT

TIMEOUT can specify the number of seconds after which the posframe
will auto-hide.

 (15) REFRESH

If REFRESH is a number, posframe's frame-size will be re-adjusted
every REFRESH seconds.

 (17) ACCEPT-FOCUS

When ACCEPT-FOCUS is non-nil, posframe will accept focus.
be careful, you may face some bugs when set it to non-nil.

 (18) HIDEHANDLER

HIDEHANDLER is a function, when it return t, posframe will be
hide, this function has a plist argument:

  (:posframe-buffer xxx
   :posframe-parent-buffer xxx)

The builtin hidehandler functions are listed below:

1. `posframe-hidehandler-when-buffer-switch'

 (19) REFPOSHANDLER

REFPOSHANDLER is a function, a reference position (most is
top-left of current frame) will be returned when call this
function.

when it is nil or it return nil, child-frame feature will be used
and reference position will be deal with in Emacs.

The user case I know at the moment is let ivy-posframe work well
in EXWM environment (let posframe show on the other application
window).

         DO NOT USE UNLESS NECESSARY!!!

An example parent frame poshandler function is:

1. `posframe-refposhandler-xwininfo'

 (19) Others

You can use `posframe-delete-all' to delete all posframes.

:flags      `ask' or a list of command line flags that will be used when
            invoking the search.
:menu       Bind the command into `rg-menu'.  Must be a list with three

When this mode is enabled \\[isearch-forward], among other keys,
starts an incremental search in this PDF document.  Since this mode
uses external programs to highlight found matches via
image-processing, proceeding to the next match may be slow.

Therefore two isearch behaviours have been defined: Normal isearch and
batch mode.  The later one is a minor mode
(`pdf-isearch-batch-mode'), which when activated inhibits isearch
from stopping at and highlighting every single match, but rather
display them batch-wise.  Here a batch means a number of matches
currently visible in the selected window.

The kind of highlighting is determined by three faces
`pdf-isearch-match' (for the current match), `pdf-isearch-lazy'
(for all other matches) and `pdf-isearch-batch' (when in batch
mode), which see.

Colors may also be influenced by the minor-mode

dark colors, are used (see e.g. `frame-background-mode'), instead

Return items matching QUERY in BUFFERS-OR-FILES.

BUFFERS-OR-FILES is a file or buffer, a list of files and/or
buffers, or a function which returns such a list.

QUERY is an `org-ql' query sexp (quoted, since this is a
function).

ACTION is a function which is called on each matching entry with
point at the beginning of its heading.  It may be:

- `element' or nil: Equivalent to `org-element-headline-parser'.

- `element-with-markers': Equivalent to calling
  `org-element-headline-parser', with markers added using
  `org-ql--add-markers'.  Suitable for formatting with
  `org-ql-view--format-element', allowing insertion into an Org
  Agenda-like buffer.

- A sexp, which will be byte-compiled into a lambda function.

- A function symbol.

If NARROW is non-nil, buffers are not widened (the default is to
widen and search the entire buffer).

SORT is either nil, in which case items are not sorted; or one or
a list of defined `org-ql' sorting methods (`date', `deadline',
`scheduled', `closed', `todo', `priority', `reverse', or `random'); or a
user-defined comparator function that accepts two items as
arguments and returns nil or non-nil.  Sorting methods are
applied in the order given (i.e. later methods override earlier
ones), and `reverse' may be used more than once.

For example, `(date priority)' would present items with the
highest priority first, and within each priority the oldest items
would appear first.  In contrast, `(date reverse priority)' would
also present items with the highest priority first, but within
each priority the newest items would appear first.

Migrate from org-gtd v3 to v4 property-based and dependency system.

This migration performs FOUR required steps:

STEP 1: Migrate ORG_GTD properties
  - Level 1 category headings: Renames ORG_GTD → ORG_GTD_REFILE
    (preserves them as refile targets for org-gtd's refile system)
  - Level 2+ items: Adds ORG_GTD property to mark item type
  - Project tasks: Adds ORG_GTD=\"Actions\" property

STEP 2: Migrate delegated items to new type
  - Items with DELEGATED_TO property: Changes ORG_GTD from
    \"Actions\" to \"Delegated\"
  - This separates delegated items from regular single actions

STEP 3: Migrate habits to have ORG_GTD property
  - Items with STYLE=\"habit\": Adds ORG_GTD=\"Habit\"
  - This ensures habits are discoverable via the unified type
    system

STEP 4: Add dependency properties to projects
  - Adds ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON and ORG_GTD_BLOCKS for sequential
    dependencies
  - Adds ORG_GTD_FIRST_TASKS to project headings
  - Sets correct NEXT/TODO states based on dependencies

AFTER UPGRADE:

Your level 1 category headings now use ORG_GTD_REFILE property and
can serve as refile targets. You can:
  - Move these headings anywhere in org-agenda-files (any level)
  - Create new refile targets by adding ORG_GTD_REFILE property
  - Configure org-refile-targets - org-gtd merges your targets with
    its own

Items can now exist anywhere in org-agenda-files - ORG_GTD_REFILE
markers are purely for organizational convenience. Your
org-refile-targets appear first in completion, followed by org-gtd's
property-based targets.

This is REQUIRED for org-gtd v4 to work correctly. The old
TRIGGER-based project system no longer works - v4 uses dependency
properties instead.

Simple example - show all next actions:

  (org-gtd-view-show

Always rename the file where it is located in the file system:

If in Dired, consider FILE to be the one at point, else the
current file, else prompt with minibuffer completion for one.
When called from Lisp, FILE is a file system path represented as
a string.

If FILE has a Denote-compliant identifier, retain it while
updating components of the file name referenced by the user
option `denote-prompts'.  By default, these are the TITLE and
KEYWORDS.  The SIGNATURE is another one.  When called from Lisp,
TITLE and SIGNATURE are strings, while KEYWORDS is a list of
strings.

The IDENTIFIER is a string that has the format of variable
`denote-date-identifier-format'.

If there is no identifier, create a new identifier using
`denote-get-identifier-function'.  By default, it creates a new
identifier using the date parameter, the date of last modification or
the `current-time'.

In interactive use, and assuming `denote-prompts' includes a
title entry, make the TITLE prompt have prefilled text in the
minibuffer that consists of the current title of FILE.  The
current title is either retrieved from the front matter (such as
the #+title in Org) or from the file name.

Do the same for the SIGNATURE prompt, subject to `denote-prompts',
by prefilling the minibuffer with the current signature of FILE,
if any.

Same principle for the KEYWORDS prompt: convert the keywords in
the file name into a comma-separated string and prefill the
minibuffer with it (the KEYWORDS prompt accepts more than one
keywords, each separated by a comma, else the `crm-separator').

For all prompts, interpret an empty input as an instruction to
remove that file name component.  For example, if a TITLE prompt
is available and FILE is 20240211T093531--some-title__keyword1.org
then rename FILE to 20240211T093531__keyword1.org.

In interactive use, if there is no entry for a file name
component in `denote-prompts', keep it as-is.

When called from Lisp, the special symbol `keep-current' can be
used for the TITLE, KEYWORDS, SIGNATURE, DATE, and IDENTIFIER
parameters to keep them as-is.

[ NOTE: Please check with your minibuffer user interface how to
  provide an empty input.  The Emacs default setup accepts the
  empty minibuffer contents as they are, though popular packages
  like `vertico' use the first available completion candidate
  instead.  For `vertico', the user must either move one up to
  select the prompt and then type RET there with empty contents,
  or use the command `vertico-exit-input' with empty contents.
  That Vertico command is bound to M-RET as of this writing on
  2024-02-13 08:08 +0200. ]

As a final step, ask for confirmation, showing the difference
between old and new file names.  Do not ask for confirmation if
the user option `denote-rename-confirmations' does not contain
the symbol `modify-file-name'.

If FILE has front matter for TITLE and KEYWORDS, ask to rewrite
their values in order to reflect the new input, unless
`denote-rename-confirmations' lacks `rewrite-front-matter'.  When
the `denote-save-buffers' is nil (the default), do not save the
underlying buffer, thus giving the user the option to
double-check the result, such as by invoking the command
`diff-buffer-with-file'.  The rewrite of the TITLE and KEYWORDS
in the front matter should not affect the rest of the front
matter.

If the file does not have front matter but is among the supported file
types (per the user option `denote-file-type'), add front matter to the
top of it and leave the buffer unsaved for further inspection.  Save the
buffer if `denote-save-buffers' is non-nil.

When `denote-kill-buffers' is t or `on-rename', kill the buffer
if it was not already being visited before the rename operation.

For the front matter of each file type, refer to the variables:

- `denote-org-front-matter'
- `denote-text-front-matter'
- `denote-toml-front-matter'
- `denote-yaml-front-matter'

Construct the file name in accordance with the user option
`denote-file-name-components-order'.

Run the `denote-after-rename-file-hook' after renaming FILE.

This command is intended to (i) rename Denote files, (ii) convert
existing supported file types to Denote notes, and (ii) rename
non-note files (e.g. PDF) that can benefit from Denote's
file-naming scheme.

For a version of this command that works with multiple files
one-by-one, use `denote-dired-rename-files'.

(autoload 'consult-grep "consult" "\
Search with `grep' for files in DIR where the content matches a regexp.

The initial input is given by the INITIAL argument.  DIR can be nil, a
directory string or a list of file/directory paths.  If `consult-grep'
is called interactively with a prefix argument, the user can specify the
directories or files to search in.  Multiple directories or files must
be separated by comma in the minibuffer, since they are read via
`completing-read-multiple'.  By default the project directory is used if
`consult-project-function' is defined and returns non-nil.  Otherwise
the `default-directory' is searched.  If the command is invoked with a
double prefix argument (twice `C-u') the user is asked for a project, if
not yet inside a project, or the current project is searched.

The input string is split, the first part of the string (grep input) is
passed to the asynchronous grep process and the second part of the
string is passed to the completion-style filtering.

The input string is split at a punctuation character, which is given as
the first character of the input string.  The format is similar to
Perl-style regular expressions, e.g., /regexp/.  Furthermore command
line options can be passed to grep, specified behind --.  The overall
prompt input has the form `#async-input -- grep-opts#filter-string'.

Note that the grep input string is transformed from Emacs regular
expressions to Posix regular expressions.  Always enter Emacs regular
expressions at the prompt.  `consult-grep' behaves like builtin Emacs
search commands, e.g., Isearch, which take Emacs regular expressions.
Furthermore the asynchronous input split into words, each word must
match separately and in any order.  See `consult--regexp-compiler' for
the inner workings.  In order to disable transformations of the grep
input, adjust `consult--regexp-compiler' accordingly.

Here we give a few example inputs:

#alpha beta         : Search for alpha and beta in any order.
#alpha.*beta        : Search for alpha before beta.
#\\(alpha\\|beta\\) : Search for alpha or beta (Note Emacs syntax!)
#word -- -C3        : Search for word, include 3 lines as context
#first#second       : Search for first, quick filter for second.

- Association list of nodes and their degrees, e.g.:
  `(((id . \"20210104T194405\") (name . \"Platonic Solids\") (keywords \"math\"'
  `\"geometry\") (type . \"org\") (degree . 4)) ...)'.
  In the context of Denote, the degree of a node is the unweighted sum of links
  and backlinks from and to a note.
- Association list of edges and their weights, e.g.:
  `(((source . \"20220529T190246\") (target . \"20201229T143000\")'
  `(weight . 1)) ...)'.
  The weight of an edge indicates the number of time it occurs in the graph.

This list is passed on to an encoding function to generate the desired graph
format.  In the last step, a visualisation function displays the graph in the
external web browser, except for the GEXF format.

The parameters for the generated graph are stored in
`denote-explore-network-previous', which is used to renegerate the same graph

Start the executable PROGRAM asynchronously named NAME.  See `async-start'.
PROGRAM is passed PROGRAM-ARGS, calling FINISH-FUNC with the
process object when done.  If FINISH-FUNC is nil, the future
object will return the process object when the program is
finished.  Set DEFAULT-DIRECTORY to change PROGRAM's current
working directory.

(fn NAME PROGRAM FINISH-FUNC &rest PROGRAM-ARGS)")
(autoload 'async-start "async" "\
Execute START-FUNC (often a lambda) in a subordinate Emacs process.
When done, the return value is passed to FINISH-FUNC.  Example:

    (async-start
       ;; What to do in the child process
       (lambda ()
         (message \"This is a test\")
         (sleep-for 3)
         222)

       ;; What to do when it finishes
       (lambda (result)
         (message \"Async process done, result should be 222: %s\"
                  result)))

If you call `async-send' from a child process, the message will
be also passed to the FINISH-FUNC.  You can test RESULT to see if
it is a message by using `async-message-p'.  If nil, it means
this is the final result.  Example of the FINISH-FUNC:

    (lambda (result)
      (if (async-message-p result)
          (message \"Received a message from child process: %s\" result)
        (message \"Async process done, result: %s\" result)))

If FINISH-FUNC is nil or missing, a future is returned that can
be inspected using `async-get', blocking until the value is
ready.  Example:

    (let ((proc (async-start
                   ;; What to do in the child process
                   (lambda ()
                     (message \"This is a test\")
                     (sleep-for 3)
                     222))))

        (message \"I'm going to do some work here\") ;; ....

        (message \"Waiting on async process, result should be 222: %s\"
                 (async-get proc)))

If you don't want to use a callback, and you don't care about any
return value from the child process, pass the `ignore' symbol as
the second argument (if you don't, and never call `async-get', it
will leave *emacs* process buffers hanging around):

    (async-start
     (lambda ()
       (delete-file \"a remote file on a slow link\" nil))
     \\='ignore)

Special case:
If the output of START-FUNC is a string with properties
e.g. (buffer-string) RESULT will be transformed in a list where the
car is the string itself (without props) and the cdr the rest of
properties, this allows using in FINISH-FUNC the string without
properties and then apply the properties in cdr to this string (if
needed).
Properties handling special objects like markers are returned as
list to allow restoring them later.
See <https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async/issues/145> for more infos.

Note: Even when FINISH-FUNC is present, a future is still
returned except that it yields no value (since the value is
passed to FINISH-FUNC).  Call `async-get' on such a future always
returns nil.  It can still be useful, however, as an argument to
`async-ready' or `async-wait'.
